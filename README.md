# Nahal-Zimri Android App

## About the association:
Nahal Zimmri is a seasonal stream in northern Jerusalem. The organization initiates many community events(education tours, cleaning events, and more). Also, it tracks and monitors the number and types of animals living around the stream. Finally, the organization offers some tour/blossoming routes for the individuals.

## Project Goals:
This project provides an Android\iOS app for the community and association, allows easy access for the touring routes, information about the site, and events. The app will also provide the association a way to collect data and monitor the animal count and blossoming around the siteâ€™s area, using the site's visitors reports.
